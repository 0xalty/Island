# Islands
Curation media

## Statement
In a vast marketplace such as OpenSea where there are rows after rows of works belonging to mega-collectors, viewers may be discouraged from even browsing the pages to search for artworks, and lesser known artists with fewer assets tend to sink into the background.
Is there a way construct a system that allows more flexibility and fluidity in the exposure of these works so that they have a better chance at entering the global market?

We believe that blockchain technology will re-define the order constructed within the current digital ecosystem. Islands: curation media + NFT marketplace is a platform where users can curate works according to their aesthetics and create “islands” themselves, ultimately resulting in the creation of a group of archipelagos. Each island becomes a reflection of the user’s own worldview where unique cultures can flourish. When each of these islands connect and interact, the works will flow with more fluidity and will stimulate a more active movement within the market as a whole.
